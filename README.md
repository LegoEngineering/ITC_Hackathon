# ITC_Hackathon
Shuk App

This app was built in 48 hours by a team of 5. The goal was to create a wireframe for a web app very similar to yelp for the otherwise non-digital open market in Tel-Aviv.

The App won 2nd place in the Hackathon at the Paypal HQ there.

Files are dragged and dropped from original git branch. My colleaues did write much of this code, but I am including it separately as a repository because I wrote most of my code on my collaborators' computers. Most of my contribution was to the architeture and design.
