# ITC_Hackathon
Shuk App

This app was built in 48 hours by a team of four. The goal was to create a wireframe for a web app very similar to yelp for the otherwise non-digital open market in Tel-Aviv.

The App won 2nd place in the Hackathon at the Paypal HQ there.

Files are dragged and dropped from original git branch. My contribution was to the architeture and design.
